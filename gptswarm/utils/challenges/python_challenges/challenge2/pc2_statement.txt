A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
- It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
- It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
- It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "Baaabb0" is weak, but "Baaba0" is strong).

Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.

In one step, you can:
- Insert one character to password,
- Delete one character from password, or
- Replace one character of password with another character.
 

Example 1:
Input: password = "a"
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: password = "aA1"
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: password = "1337C0d3"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:
1 <= password.length <= 50
password consists of letters, digits, dot '.' or exclamation mark '!'.

Include only the following function in your answer enclosed in a code block.
```python
def strongPasswordChecker(s: str) -> int:
    """
    :type s: str
    :rtype: int
    """
    pass
```
